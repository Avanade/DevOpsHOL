# Avanade DevOps HOL - Lab 2 - Add QA environment and define your multi-stage continuous deployment process with approvals and gates

In this lab, we introduce a QA environment and setup our multi-stage continuous deployment process by adding approvals and gates.

Based on the following tutorials:
- [Set up staging environments in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-staged-publishing)
- [Define your multi-stage continuous deployment (CD) process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/define-multistage-release-process)

## Prerequisites

- Complete [Lab 1 - Create a CI/CD pipeline for .NET with the Azure DevOps Project](lab-1-azure-devops-project-pipeline.md).

## Tasks

First, let's define the QA environment:

1. Add a QA Deployment Slot to your App Service in Azure

1. Add a QA environment to your Release Definiton in VSTS

1. Configure the deployment step for the QA slot in the same App Service

1. Run a new Release

1. Review the new QA website is live on \<yourappservice\>-qa.azurewebsites.net

Use approvals and gates to control your deployment

1. Add pre deployment approval to control promotion from QA to Production

1. Add gate on 'Active Bugs' = 0
