# Avanade DevOps HOL
These are the hands on labs associated with the Avanade DevOps Practitioners course.  This is based to a large part on the [PartsUnlimitedHOL](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedE2E/blob/master/PartsUnlimited-aspnet45/docs/GettingStarted.md) but simplified to use the Visual Studio MVC sample application.  It does not use the PartsUnlimited HOL, but we want to acknowledge that project's contribution to this project.

You can accomplish these labs using an Azure VM as the development machine. This not only keeps you from having to make changes to your local environment, but it gives you additional experience using Azure and PowerShell. To start setting up your environment, make sure to follow the steps in the Prerequisites lab.
