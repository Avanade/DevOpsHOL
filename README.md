# Avanade DevOps Hands-On Labs
The labs can be completed using an Azure Virtual Machine as development environment. This not only keeps you from having to make changes to your local environment, but it gives you additional experience using Azure and PowerShell. The [Prerequisites](azure-rm/README.md) instructions help you to set up this environment.
